# Bot Performance Analysis & Testing Results - 2025-10-28

## Executive Summary

Comprehensive analysis of two FreqTrade bots running LEA-LSTM and FinAgent strategies. Analysis reveals entry timing issues causing current unrealized losses despite 100% historical win rate.

## Quick Stats

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Total Trades** | 6 |
| **Closed Trades** | 4 (100% win rate) |
| **Open Trades** | 2 (both losing) |
| **Closed P&L** | +2.58% (+0.009 BTC / $1,029) |
| **Total P&L** | -2.98% (-0.010 BTC / -$1,145) |
| **Best Pair** | UNI/BTC (+0.66% avg on closed) |

## Current Bot Status

✅ **Bot 1 (LEA-LSTM)**: Running on port 8080 with auto-start  
✅ **Bot 2 (FinAgent)**: Running on port 8081 with auto-start

## Critical Issues Found

### 1. Entry Timing Problems
- **UNI/BTC**: Entered at 24h high, immediate reversal → -4.07%
- **LTC/BTC**: Entered near resistance, weak follow-through → -1.10%
- **Root Cause**: ML model too optimistic (71.9% bullish predictions)

### 2. Strategy Configuration Issues
- Entry threshold too low: 0.2% (should be 0.5%)
- No RSI overbought filter (was removed)
- ROI targets too aggressive (2% immediate)
- No trailing stop-loss enabled

### 3. Risk Management
- ⚠️ UNI/BTC only 0.9% from -5% stop-loss trigger
- ✅ LTC/BTC safe distance (3.9% cushion)
- ✅ Position sizing reasonable (0.3 BTC each)
- ✅ Stop-losses configured correctly

## Recommendations Implemented

✅ Started Bot 2 (FinAgent) for strategy diversification  
✅ Configured auto-start for both bots (systemd services)  
✅ Created comprehensive analysis documentation  
✅ Identified specific code changes needed

## Recommendations Pending

### High Priority
- [ ] Increase entry threshold from 0.2% to 0.5% (LeaFreqAIStrategy.py:224)
- [ ] Re-enable RSI < 70 filter to avoid overbought entries
- [ ] Monitor UNI/BTC for potential stop-loss trigger

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Implement trailing stop-loss after +1% profit
- [ ] Adjust ROI targets to more achievable levels
- [ ] Retrain ML model with 60+ days of diverse market data

### Long-term
- [ ] Backtest new parameters before live deployment
- [ ] Compare Bot 1 vs Bot 2 performance over 7 days
- [ ] Add volatility filters to entry conditions

## System Setup

### Auto-Start Services
Both bots now start automatically on system boot:
- `freqtrade-bot1.service` - LEA-LSTM Strategy
- `freqtrade-bot2.service` - FinAgent Strategy

**Features:**
- Auto-start on boot
- Auto-restart on failure
- Systemd log management
- Survives SSH disconnection

**Management:**
```bash
sudo systemctl status freqtrade-bot1    # Check status
sudo systemctl restart freqtrade-bot1   # Restart bot
sudo journalctl -u freqtrade-bot1 -f   # View logs
```

## Web Interfaces

- **Bot 1**: http://localhost:8080
- **Bot 2**: http://localhost:8081
- **Login**: admin / (see .env file)

## Key Insights

1. **Historical performance is good** - 100% win rate on closed trades
2. **Current losses are timing-related** - Entered at local tops
3. **ML model needs retraining** - Too optimistic, likely overfitted
4. **Risk management is sound** - Stop-losses properly configured
5. **Bot diversification reduces risk** - Two different strategies now running

## Testing Status

- ✅ Analysis completed
- ✅ Issues identified
- ✅ Bot 2 deployed
- ✅ Auto-start configured
- ✅ Documentation created
- ⏳ Strategy improvements pending
- ⏳ Model retraining pending
- ⏳ Backtesting pending

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor** UNI/BTC for stop-loss trigger (critical)
2. **Wait** for Bot 2 model training to complete (15-30 min)
3. **Review** Bot 2 first trades for comparison
4. **Implement** recommended strategy improvements
5. **Retrain** ML models with longer data history
6. **Backtest** before deploying to live trading
