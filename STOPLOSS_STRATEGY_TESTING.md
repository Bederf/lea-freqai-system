| Stoploss | Trades | Win Rate | ROI Exits (Profit) | Stoploss Hits (Loss) | Total Profit | vs Market |
|----------|--------|----------|-------------------|----------------------|--------------|-----------|
| **3%** | 137 | 73.7% | 106 (+19.93 BTC) | 35 (-33.85 BTC) | **-15.28%** | +7.91% |
| **5% ✅** | **109** | **83.5%** | **91 (+17.22 BTC)** | **17 (-27.71 BTC)** | **-10.75%** | **+12.44%** |

| **7%** | 72 | 84.7% | 61 (+11.71 BTC) | 10 (-22.79 BTC) | **-11.59%** | +11.60% |

### Analysis

**3% Stoploss: TOO TIGHT**
- ❌ Too many stoploss hits (35 trades)
- ❌ Highest total stoploss losses (-33.85 BTC)
- ❌ Lower win rate (73.7%)
- ❌ Cuts trades that could recover
- ✅ More total trades (137)
- **Verdict:** Stops out winners prematurely

**5% Stoploss: ✅ OPTIMAL**
- ✅ Best overall profit (-10.75%)
- ✅ Highest market outperformance (+12.44%)
- ✅ Excellent win rate (83.5%)
- ✅ Good trade sample size (109)
- ✅ Balanced stoploss hits (17 trades)
- **Verdict:** Sweet spot between protection and room to breathe

**6% Stoploss: ACCEPTABLE**
- ⚠️ Worse than 5% (-13.86% vs -10.75%)
- ✅ Fewer stoploss hits (15)
- ❌ But stoploss losses more expensive (-29.05 BTC)
- ⚠️ Fewer total trades (98)
- **Verdict:** Too loose, losers run longer

**7% Stoploss: TOO LOOSE**
- ❌ Fewest trades (72)
- ❌ Highest stoploss loss per trade (-7.14% avg)
- ❌ Losers held too long (avg 4 days 21h)
- ✅ Highest win rate (84.7%)
- **Verdict:** Lets losers bleed too much

---

## 2. Dynamic Stoploss Testing

### Approach: ATR-Based Volatility Adjustment

**Concept:** Adjust stoploss based on current market volatility
```python
if atr_percent > 2.0:
    stoploss = -0.03  # Tight in high volatility
elif atr_percent > 1.0:
    stoploss = -0.04  # Medium
else:
    stoploss = -0.06  # Loose in low volatility
```

**Results:**
- Trades: 125
- Win Rate: 79.2%
- Total Profit: -11.84%
- **Issue:** Good concept but implementation had trailing effects

**Verdict:** ❌ Added complexity without benefit

---

### Approach: Time-Based Adjustment

**Concept:** Give trades more room initially, tighten over time
```python
if trade_duration < 30 min:
    adjustment = +0.01  # Loose initially (-4% becomes -3%)
elif trade_duration < 120 min:
    adjustment = 0.0    # Standard
else:
    adjustment = -0.01  # Tighter after 2 hours (-4% becomes -5%)
```

**Results:**
- **MAJOR ISSUE:** Created unintended trailing stop effect!
- When stoploss tightened from -3% to -4%, it caught losing trades
- Resulted in 19-37 "trailing_stop" exits for -20 to -29 BTC loss
- These appeared as trailing stop exits in backtest results

**Verdict:** ❌ DANGEROUS - Creates trailing effect on losers

**Key Learning:** **NEVER tighten stoploss over time** - it creates a trailing stop on losing trades!

---

### Approach: Prediction-Based Adjustment

**Concept:** Tighter stops for weak ML predictions
```python
if prediction > 0.01:  # Strong (>1%)
    adjustment = +0.01  # Looser stop
elif prediction > 0.005:  # Medium (0.5-1%)
    adjustment = 0.0
else:  # Weak (<0.5%)
    adjustment = -0.01  # Tighter stop
```

**Results:**
- Didn't significantly improve results
- Added complexity
- Difficult to validate effectiveness

**Verdict:** ❌ Marginal benefit not worth complexity

---

## 3. Trailing Stop Testing

### Initial Configuration
```python
trailing_stop = True
trailing_stop_positive = 0.005  # Activate at 0.5%
trailing_stop_positive_offset = 0.01  # Trail at 1%
```

**Results:** 23-37 trades exiting via trailing_stop
- Total Loss: -20.56 to -28.92 BTC
- Average Loss: -2.52% to -3.58% per trade  
- Win Rate: 0-17.4%
- **Issue:** All trailing stop exits were LOSSES

**Why Trailing Stops Failed:**
1. Trades briefly went into profit (0.5-1%)
2. Market reversed before reaching ROI
3. Trailing stop triggered on the way down
4. Resulted in small losses instead of letting ROI work
5. ROI exits have 100% win rate, trailing stops had 0-17% win rate

### Adjustments Tested

**Tighter Triggers:**
```python
trailing_stop_positive = 0.01  # 1% instead of 0.5%
trailing_stop_positive_offset = 0.015  # 1.5% instead of 1%
```
- Still caused losses
- Reduced exits to 19 but still all losers

**Complete Disable:**
```python
trailing_stop = False
```
- ✅ Eliminated all trailing stop losses
- ✅ Let ROI do its job  
- ✅ Improved results

**Verdict:** ❌ Trailing stops don't work for this strategy

---

## 4. Custom Stoploss Function Testing

### Implementation

```python
def custom_stoploss(self, pair, trade, current_time, current_rate, current_profit, **kwargs):
    # Combined ATR + Time + Prediction adjustments
    dynamic_stoploss = volatility_stoploss + time_adjustment + prediction_adjustment
    return max(min(dynamic_stoploss, -0.02), -0.10)
```

### Results

**With Custom Stoploss:**
- Trades showed "trailing_stop" exits even when `trailing_stop = False`
- Caused -20 to -29 BTC in trailing stop losses
- 19-37 unwanted exits

**Root Cause:**
- When custom stoploss returned a **less negative** value over time (e.g., -4% → -2%), it acted like a trailing stop
- This caught losing trades that were below the initial stoploss
- Freqtrade reports these as "trailing_stop" exits

**Example:**
```
Initial: stoploss = -4% (price can drop 4%)
After 1 hour: custom_stoploss returns -2% (tighter)
Trade at -3% loss: Gets stopped out (caught by trailing effect)
Reported as: "trailing_stop" exit
```

**Verdict:** ❌ Custom stoploss creates unintended trailing effects

---

## Key Findings

### Finding #1: Simpler Is Better

**Complex Approaches (FAILED):**
- Dynamic ATR-based stoploss
- Time-based adjustments
- Prediction-based adjustments  
- Multi-factor combinations

**Simple Approach (SUCCEEDED):**
- Fixed 5% stoploss
- No adjustments
- Predictable and reliable

**Result:** Simple fixed stoploss outperformed all complex approaches

---

### Finding #2: Never Tighten Stoploss

**Critical Discovery:**

Any stoploss that becomes **less negative over time** creates a trailing stop effect on LOSING trades.

**Examples of Tightening (DON'T DO THIS):**
- Starting at -5%, moving to -3% ❌
- Wide initially, narrow later ❌
- Loose in first hour, tight after 2 hours ❌

**Safe Approaches:**
- Fixed stoploss that never changes ✅
- Stoploss that loosens but never tightens ✅ (but no benefit found)

---

### Finding #3: ROI > Exit Signals

**ROI Exits:**
- 91 trades
- +17.22 BTC profit
- 100% win rate
- Avg: +0.61% profit
- Avg duration: 16h 9min

**Exit Signal Exits:**
- 70-160 trades (depending on config)
- -16.36 to -20.28 BTC loss
- 21-37% win rate
- Avg: -0.4% to -0.77% loss
- Avg duration: 3-12 hours

**Conclusion:** ROI exits are 35+ BTC more profitable than signal exits

---

### Finding #4: Trailing Stops Hurt Performance

**All Trailing Stop Tests:**
- Every single trailing stop exit resulted in a net loss
- 19-37 trades via trailing stop = -20 to -29 BTC total loss
- 0-17% win rate (vs 100% for ROI exits)

**Why:**
- Catches trades in brief profit that don't reach ROI
- Market volatility causes false triggers
- ROI table works better for crypto volatility

---

### Finding #5: Optimal Stoploss = 5%

**Testing Range:** 3% to 7%

**Sweet Spot:** 5%
- Tight enough to protect capital (17 stoploss hits)
- Loose enough to avoid false stops (83.5% win rate)
- Best overall profit (-10.75%)
- Best market outperformance (+12.44%)

**Below 5%:** Too many false stops  
**Above 5%:** Losers bleed too much

---

## Recommendations

### ✅ DO Use

1. **Fixed 5% Stoploss**
   ```python
   stoploss = -0.05
   use_custom_stoploss = False
   ```

2. **ROI Table for Exits**
   ```python
   minimal_roi = {
       "0": 0.02,
       "20": 0.015,
       "40": 0.01,
       "90": 0.005
   }
   ```

3. **Disable Trailing Stop**
   ```python
   trailing_stop = False
   ```

4. **Disable Exit Signals**
   ```python
   use_exit_signal = False
   ```

### ❌ DON'T Use

1. **Custom Stoploss Functions**
   - Creates trailing effects
   - Adds complexity
   - No performance benefit

2. **Trailing Stop**
   - All exits were losses
   - Interferes with ROI exits
   - Doesn't work well with crypto volatility

3. **Exit Signals**
   - ML predictions poor for exits
   - Lost 16-20 BTC in testing
   - ROI exits far superior

4. **Very Tight Stoploss (<5%)**
   - Too many false stops
   - Lower win rate
   - Worse overall performance

5. **Very Loose Stoploss (>7%)**
   - Losers held too long
   - Fewer trades
   - Larger average losses

## 5. Dynamic Stoploss with Multiple Factors

### Configuration

**Combined:** ATR + Time + Prediction adjustments

```python
use_custom_stoploss = True

def custom_stoploss(...):
    # ATR-based
    if atr_percent > 2.0:
        base = -0.03
    elif atr_percent > 1.0:
        base = -0.04
    else:
        base = -0.06
    
    # Time adjustment  
    if duration < 30min:
        time_adj = +0.01  # Loose initially
    elif duration < 120min:
        time_adj = 0.0
    else:
        time_adj = -0.01  # TIGHTER (problem!)
    
    # Prediction adjustment
    if prediction > 0.01:
        pred_adj = +0.01
    elif prediction > 0.005:
        pred_adj = 0.0
    else:
        pred_adj = -0.01
    
    return base + time_adj + pred_adj
```

### Results

**First Test (with tightening):**
```
Total Trades: 125
Win Rate: 79.2%
Total Profit: -11.84%

Exit Breakdown:
- ROI: 95 trades (+16.98 BTC)
- Stoploss: 6 trades (-8.0 BTC)  
- "Trailing Stop": 23 trades (-20.56 BTC) ← PROBLEM!
- Force Exit: 1 trade (-0.26 BTC)
```

**Issue Identified:**
- The `time_adj = -0.01` after 2 hours was causing trailing effect
- Freqtrade reported these as "trailing_stop" exits
- Lost -20.56 BTC to this unintended behavior

**Second Test (without tightening):**
```python
if duration < 60min:
    time_adj = +0.02  # Loose initially
else:
    time_adj = 0.0  # Never tighten!
```

**Results:**
- Still showed trailing stop exits due to cached code
- Performance similar to fixed stoploss
- No benefit from added complexity

**Verdict:** ❌ Custom stoploss adds no value, creates problems

---

## The Trailing Stop Mystery

### Problem

Even after setting `trailing_stop = False`, backtests kept showing trailing_stop exits.

### Investigation

**What We Tried:**
1. Set `trailing_stop = False` ❌ Still appeared
2. Removed `trailing_stop_positive` parameters ❌ Still appeared
3. Cleared Python cache ❌ Still appeared
4. Created new strategy file with different name ❌ Still appeared

**Root Cause Found:**

The `custom_stoploss()` function was **creating** trailing stop effects!

When the function returned a less negative value over time:
- Start: Returns -5% (loose)
- Later: Returns -3% (tight)
- Effect: Acts like a trailing stop

Freqtrade correctly reports these as "trailing_stop" exits because the stoploss did trail (tighten).

### Solution

**Remove custom_stoploss entirely:**
```python
use_custom_stoploss = False

# Delete the custom_stoploss() function
# Use simple fixed stoploss instead
```

**Result:** ✅ No more trailing stop exits

---

## Best Practices Discovered

### 1. Keep Stoploss Simple

✅ **DO:**
```python
stoploss = -0.05  # Simple, fixed, predictable
use_custom_stoploss = False
```

❌ **DON'T:**
```python
use_custom_stoploss = True
def custom_stoploss(...):
    # Complex logic that might tighten
    return dynamic_value
```

### 2. Never Tighten Stoploss

✅ **SAFE:**
```python
# Stoploss stays constant or loosens
initial = -0.05
later = -0.05  # Same
# OR
later = -0.07  # Looser (but no benefit found)
```

❌ **DANGEROUS:**
```python
# Stoploss tightens = trailing effect
initial = -0.05
later = -0.03  # Tighter = trailing stop on losers!
```

### 3. Disable Trailing Stop

✅ **DO:**
```python
trailing_stop = False
# Don't set any other trailing parameters
```

❌ **DON'T:**
```python
trailing_stop = True  # Or even False with parameters set
trailing_stop_positive = 0.01
trailing_stop_positive_offset = 0.015
# These may activate even when trailing_stop = False
```

### 4. Let ROI Handle Winners

**ROI exits have 100% win rate** - Trust them!

Don't interfere with:
- Exit signals (ML predictions poor for exits)
- Trailing stops (cut winners short)
- Custom stoploss (creates complications)
