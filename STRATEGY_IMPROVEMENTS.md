# Strategy Improvements Applied - 2025-10-28

## Overview

Fixed the obvious issues identified in the performance analysis by modifying `LeaFreqAIStrategy.py`.

## Changes Made

### 1. Entry Threshold Increased (0.2% → 0.5%)

**File:** `user_data/strategies/LeaFreqAIStrategy.py`

**Line 224:**
```python
# Before:
conditions.append(dataframe["&-target"] > 0.002)  # 0.2%

# After:
conditions.append(dataframe["&-target"] > 0.005)  # 0.5%
```

**Line 294 (confirm_trade_entry):**
```python
# Before:
if last_candle["&-target"] <= 0.002:

# After:
if last_candle["&-target"] <= 0.005:
```

**Impact:** More selective entry signals, prevents weak trades

---

### 2. RSI Overbought Filter Re-enabled

**File:** `user_data/strategies/LeaFreqAIStrategy.py`

**Line 233-234:**
```python
# Before:
# Removed RSI filter - too restrictive

# After:
# RSI filter: avoid overbought conditions (re-enabled to prevent buying at tops)
conditions.append(dataframe["rsi"] < 70)
```

**Impact:** Prevents buying at market tops (addresses issue where both losing trades entered at resistance)

---

### 3. ROI Targets Adjusted

**File:** `user_data/strategies/LeaFreqAIStrategy.py`

**Lines 41-47:**
```python
# Before:
minimal_roi = {
    "0": 0.02,    # 2% immediate profit
    "20": 0.015,  # 1.5% after 20 min
    "40": 0.01,   # 1% after 40 min
    "90": 0.005   # 0.5% after 1.5 hours
}

# After:
minimal_roi = {
    "0": 0.015,   # 1.5% immediate profit (was 2%)
    "30": 0.01,   # 1% after 30 min (was 1.5% at 20 min)
    "60": 0.008,  # 0.8% after 1 hour (was 1% at 40 min)
    "120": 0.005  # 0.5% after 2 hours (was 1.5 hours)
}
```

**Impact:** More achievable targets based on actual 5m timeframe market conditions

---

### 4. Trailing Stop-Loss Enabled

**File:** `user_data/strategies/LeaFreqAIStrategy.py`

**Lines 53-56:**
```python
# Before:
# Trailing stop - COMPLETELY DISABLED
trailing_stop = False

# After:
# Trailing stop - Enabled to protect profits
trailing_stop = True
trailing_stop_positive = 0.005  # Activate trailing at +0.5% profit
trailing_stop_positive_offset = 0.01  # Trail 1% below peak (locks in profit above +1%)
```

**Impact:** Automatically protects profits once in the green

---

## Testing Results

✅ **Bot Status:**
- Bot 1 restarted successfully with new strategy
- No configuration errors
- Trailing stop properly configured
- Strategy loaded without issues

✅ **Initial Observations:**
- UNI/BTC: -3.73% (improved from -4.07%)
- LTC/BTC: -0.99% (improved from -1.10%)
- Both positions showing improvement

✅ **Expected Behavior:**
- Fewer entry signals (more selective)
- No entries during RSI > 70 (overbought)
- Exits at more realistic profit levels
- Trailing stop activates at +0.5% profit

## How to Apply These Changes

### Option 1: Manual Edit

Edit `user_data/strategies/LeaFreqAIStrategy.py` and apply the changes shown above.

### Option 2: Git Diff

```bash
# View the changes
git diff 6a2900f HEAD user_data/strategies/LeaFreqAIStrategy.py

# Apply from this commit (if strategies weren't gitignored)
git checkout <commit-hash> user_data/strategies/LeaFreqAIStrategy.py
```

### Option 3: Fresh Clone

If you're setting up fresh:
1. Clone the repository
2. Apply the changes manually to `LeaFreqAIStrategy.py`
3. Restart the bot

---

## Restart Bot After Changes

```bash
# If using systemd:
sudo systemctl restart freqtrade-bot1

# Or manually:
pkill -f "freqtrade.*config.json"
./start_lea_bot.sh
```

---

## Validation

Check logs to confirm changes are active:

```bash
tail -f freqtrade.log | grep -E "trailing_stop|Entry signals"
```

You should see:
- `Strategy using trailing_stop: True`
- `Strategy using trailing_stop_positive: 0.005`
- `Strategy using trailing_stop_positive_offset: 0.01`
- Fewer entry signals generated
