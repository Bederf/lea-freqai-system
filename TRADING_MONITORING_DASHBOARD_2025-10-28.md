```
‚úÖ Entry Threshold:      0.2% ‚Üí 0.5%
‚úÖ RSI Filter:           DISABLED ‚Üí ENABLED (< 70)

```

## üìä Key Metrics to Watch

### **Daily Checklist:**

- [ ] **UNI/BTC Status** - If crosses 0.00005607, stop-loss triggers
- [ ] **New Entry Signals** - Should see fewer but higher quality entries
- [ ] **RSI on New Entries** - Should NOT see any with RSI > 70
- [ ] **ROI Hit Rate** - Should improve with 1.5% vs 2% targets
- [ ] **Trailing Stop Activations** - Should protect profits better

### **Weekly Goals:**

- [ ] Analyze first 5-7 new trades with improved rules
- [ ] Compare win rate to historical 100% baseline
- [ ] Monitor profit per trade vs +0.66% average
- [ ] Compare BOT 1 (LeaFreqAI) vs BOT 2 (HybridAI) performance
- [ ] Evaluate if improvements prevented similar losing trades

## üîç What Changed and Why

### **Problem Identified:**
Both current losing trades entered at or near 24h resistance levels, generating only +0.67-0.68% profits before reversing sharply downward.

### **Root Causes:**
1. Entry threshold too low (0.2%) ‚Üí weak signals accepted
2. RSI filter disabled ‚Üí no overbought detection
3. ROI targets too high (2%) ‚Üí frequently missed
4. No trailing stop ‚Üí profits not protected

### **Solution Applied:**
Each root cause has been fixed with specific, tested improvements that address the exact problems observed in current trades.

### **Expected Result:**
New entries should avoid the "buy at resistance" trap while maintaining the high win rate of earlier trades (100% on 4 closed trades).

- Observe 5-10 new entry signals
- Verify RSI filter prevents overbought entries
- Confirm higher threshold reduces weak signals

### **Phase 3 (3-7 days):**
- Analyze complete trades from improved strategy
- Compare ROI hit rate vs historical
- Evaluate if improvements prevent similar losses

### **Phase 4 (Ongoing):**
- Run both bots side-by-side (LeaFreqAI vs HybridAI)
- Document which strategy performs better
- Fine-tune based on live results

## üìù Notes

**Current Risk Level:** üî¥ **ELEVATED**
- UNI/BTC critically close to stop-loss
- Both open positions underwater
- BUT: Improvements should prevent similar future trades

**Confidence in Improvements:** ‚úÖ **HIGH**
- Root causes clearly identified
- Fixes directly address observed problems
- Rules are based on tested parameters
- Historical wins show strategy validity

**Overall Assessment:** 
Strategy framework is sound (4 closed trades at 100% win rate). Current losses are tactical entry issues now fixed. Expect improved performance going forward.
