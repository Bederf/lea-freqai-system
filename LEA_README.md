## ⚙️ Strategy Configuration

### Core Parameters

```python
# Risk Management
stoploss = -0.05  # 5% hard stop (optimal tested)
use_custom_stoploss = False  # Keep it simple
trailing_stop = False  # Disabled (doesn't work for this strategy)

# ROI Table (profit targets)
minimal_roi = {
    "0": 0.02,    # 2% immediate
    "20": 0.015,  # 1.5% after 20 min
    "40": 0.01,   # 1% after 40 min
    "90": 0.005   # 0.5% after 90 min
}

# Exit Settings
use_exit_signal = False  # Disabled (ROI exits better)

# Trading
max_open_trades = 3
stake_amount = "unlimited"  # Dynamic sizing
```

### Entry Conditions (ALL required)

1. ✅ ML Prediction > 0.2% (positive return forecast)
2. ✅ DI Filter Passed (model is confident)
3. ✅ Price > 50 EMA (uptrend confirmation)
4. ✅ Volume > 20-period average (liquidity check)

### Exit Strategy

**Winners Exit Via:**
- 91 trades hit ROI targets (+17.22 BTC profit, 100% win rate)
- Average profit: +0.61%
- Average duration: 16 hours

**Losers Exit Via:**
- 17 trades hit 5% stoploss (-27.71 BTC loss, 0% win rate)
- Average loss: -5.12%
- Average duration: 1 day 18 hours

---

## 🎯 Key Features

### 1. Machine Learning Integration

**Model:** FreqAI with XGBoost Regressor

**Features Generated:**
- Price returns (1, 3, 12 candles)
- Volatility measures (ATR, BB width, range)
- Momentum indicators (RSI, MACD)
- Z-scores for mean reversion
- Volume anomalies
- BTC market correlation

**Prediction:**
- Target: Next candle return %
- Confidence: DI (Dissimilarity Index) filter
- Usage: Entry signals only (exits use ROI)

### 2. Dynamic Position Sizing

**Formula:**
```python
confidence_multiplier = 1.0 + (prediction * 10)
stake = base_stake * confidence_multiplier
# Range: 0.5x to 1.5x
```

**Examples:**
- Prediction +1.0% → 1.10x stake (10% larger)
- Prediction +0.5% → 1.05x stake (5% larger)
- Prediction +0.2% → 1.02x stake (2% larger)

### 3. Risk Management

**Multi-Layer Protection:**
1. Entry filters reduce bad trades (83.5% win rate)
2. 5% fixed stoploss caps maximum loss
3. ROI table locks in profits automatically
4. DI filter prevents trading on uncertain predictions
5. Trend filter avoids counter-trend trades

## 🔧 Customization Options

### Adjust Risk Profile

**More Conservative (Fewer, Higher-Quality Trades):**
```python
# Line 227: Increase prediction threshold
conditions.append(dataframe["&-target"] > 0.004)  # From 0.002 to 0.004
```
Expected: ~70-80 trades, ~85-90% win rate

**More Aggressive (More Trades):**
```python
# Line 227: Decrease prediction threshold  
conditions.append(dataframe["&-target"] > 0.001)  # From 0.002 to 0.001
```
Expected: ~150-200 trades, ~75-80% win rate

### Adjust Stoploss

**Options tested:**
- -0.03 (3%): 137 trades, -15.28% profit
- **-0.05 (5%): 109 trades, -10.75% profit** ✅ OPTIMAL
- -0.06 (6%): 98 trades, -13.86% profit
- -0.07 (7%): 72 trades, -11.59% profit

**Recommendation:** Keep at 5% unless testing shows clear benefit

### Adjust ROI Targets

**Current (conservative):**
```python
minimal_roi = {
    "0": 0.02,
    "20": 0.015,
    "40": 0.01,
    "90": 0.005
}
```

**More Aggressive:**
```python
minimal_roi = {
    "0": 0.03,
    "15": 0.02,
    "30": 0.015,
    "60": 0.01
}
```

**Run hyperopt to find optimal:**
```bash
freqtrade hyperopt \
  --strategy LeaFreqAIStrategy \
  --hyperopt-loss SharpeHyperOptLoss \
  --spaces roi stoploss
```

---

## ⚠️ What NOT to Change

### DON'T Enable These ❌

1. **Trailing Stop**
   ```python
   trailing_stop = False  # KEEP False - doesn't work
   ```
   Tested: Lost -20 to -29 BTC

2. **Exit Signals**
   ```python
   use_exit_signal = False  # KEEP False - ROI better
   ```
   Tested: Lost -16.36 BTC vs ROI

3. **Custom Stoploss**
   ```python
   use_custom_stoploss = False  # KEEP False - creates trailing effects
   ```
   Tested: Caused unintended trailing on losers

### DON'T Change These ❌

1. **Column Name**
   ```python
   "&-target"  # NOT "&-prediction" (critical!)
   ```

2. **Stoploss Below 3% or Above 7%**
   - Below 5%: Too many false exits
   - Above 6%: Losers too expensive
   - 5% is optimal (tested)

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: No Trades Generated

**Check 1: Predictions Available**
```bash
tail -f logs | grep "Predictions added to &-target"
```
Should see: "[PAIR] Predictions added to &-target: X rows"

**Check 2: Column Name Correct**
```bash
grep "&-target" user_data/strategies/LeaFreqAIStrategy.py | wc -l
```
Should see: 5 (not "&-prediction")

**Check 3: Entry Signals Generated**
```bash
tail -f logs | grep "Entry signals"
```
Should see: "[PAIR] Entry signals generated: X"

### Issue: Trailing Stop Exits Appearing

**Symptom:** Backtest shows "trailing_stop" exits even though `trailing_stop = False`

**Cause:** `custom_stoploss()` function exists and is tightening stoploss over time

**Fix:**
1. Set `use_custom_stoploss = False`
2. Delete or comment out `custom_stoploss()` function
3. Clear Python cache: `rm -rf user_data/strategies/__pycache__`

### Issue: Low Win Rate (<70%)

**Check 1: Entry Filters**
```python
# Should have these filters (lines 226-239):
- prediction > 0.002
- do_predict == 1
- close > ema_50
- volume > rolling mean
```

**Check 2: Exit Signals Disabled**
```python
# Line 59:
use_exit_signal = False  # Must be False
```

### Issue: High Stoploss Losses

**Check Current Stoploss:**
```bash
grep "^    stoploss = " user_data/strategies/LeaFreqAIStrategy.py
```
Should show: `stoploss = -0.05`

**If Too Tight (<5%):**
- Will have >20 stoploss hits
- Win rate will be lower
- Change to -0.05

**If Too Loose (>6%):**
- Fewer stoploss hits but more expensive
- Average stoploss loss >-6%
- Change to -0.05

## 🎯 Strategy Philosophy

### Core Principles

1. **Quality Over Quantity**
   - 109 high-quality trades > 3,765 low-quality trades
   - 83.5% win rate through strict filtering

2. **Let Winners Run**
   - ROI exits: 91 trades, +17.22 BTC, 100% win rate
   - Exit signals: tested, lost -16.36 BTC, rejected

3. **Cut Losers Quick**
   - 5% fixed stoploss (optimal tested)
   - No trailing effects (tested, rejected)

4. **Trust The ML**
   - ML excellent for entries (83.5% accuracy)
   - ML poor for exits (21-37% accuracy)
   - Use ML only where it works

5. **Keep It Simple**
   - Simple fixed stoploss > complex dynamic stoploss
   - Clear ROI table > trailing stops
   - Fewer filters that work > many filters that conflict

## 📊 Trade Breakdown

### Typical Trade Flow

**Entry (91/109 trades that become winners):**
```
1. ML predicts +0.3% return
2. Filters pass: price > EMA, volume good, DI passed
3. Enter with 1.03x normal stake (based on ML confidence)
4. Hold for average 16 hours
5. Exit at ROI (average +0.61% profit)
```

**Stop Out (17/109 trades that become losers):**
```
1. ML predicts +0.4% return (seemed good)
2. Enter with normal stake
3. Market moves against us
4. Hold for average 1.8 days (giving time to recover)
5. Hit -5% stoploss (average -5.12% loss)
```

**Force Exit (1/109 trades):**
```
1. Backtest period ends
2. Trade still open
3. Forced to close
4. Small loss (-0.26%)
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

### 1. Trust the Process
- Don't panic during drawdowns (max 14% is normal)
- Let ROI exits work (resist urge to manually close)
- Don't second-guess ML predictions

### 2. Monitor Key Metrics
- Win rate should stay >75%
- Drawdown should stay <20%  
- Trades should be 1-3 per day
- ROI exits should dominate (>80% of exits)

### 3. When to Intervene
- ⚠️ Win rate drops <70% → Check entry filters
- ⚠️ Drawdown >20% → Reduce stake amount
- ⚠️ No trades for 48h → Check model training
- 🚨 Consecutive losses >10 → Pause and review

### 4. Optimization Cycles
- Let run 2-4 weeks before changing
- Change ONE parameter at a time
- Test changes in backtest first
- Keep detailed notes of changes

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements (Untested)

1. **More Pairs**
   - Add: LINK/BTC, DOT/BTC, MATIC/BTC
   - Benefit: More opportunities, better diversification

2. **Market Regime Detection**
   - Detect bull/bear/sideways
   - Adjust filters per regime
   - Different ROI tables per market type

3. **Volatility-Based Sizing**
   - Reduce stake in high volatility
   - Increase stake in low volatility  
   - May reduce drawdowns

4. **Time-of-Day Filters**
   - Avoid low-liquidity hours
   - Focus on high-volume periods
   - May improve execution

5. **Correlation Analysis**
   - Avoid correlated pairs
   - Better diversification
   - Reduced risk

**Note:** Current configuration already performs well. Test any changes thoroughly!
