# LEA Strategy Implementation Progress

**Date:** 2025-10-12
**Status:** ✅ FULLY OPERATIONAL - Bot Running Successfully

---

## Latest Update: 2025-10-12 07:48 UTC

### 🎉 All Critical Issues Fixed!

The LEA LSTM FreqTrade bot is now **fully operational** and training models successfully.

**Current Status:**
- ✅ Bot running (PID 3568, 3675)
- ✅ Models training without errors
- ✅ 0% data dropped due to NaNs (fixed!)
- ✅ No matrix dimension errors (fixed!)
- ✅ Strategy handles missing predictions gracefully
- 🔄 Initial model training in progress (~10 min remaining)

---

## What We Built

### 1. **LSTM Model** ✅ FIXED
**File:** `/home/pi/lea-freqai-system/user_data/freqaimodels/LeaTorchLSTM.py`

**Major Fix (2025-10-12):**
- Completely rewrote model to handle 2D input from FreqAI
- Simplified architecture to avoid dimension mismatch errors
- Model now properly reshapes input for LSTM processing

**Architecture:**
```
Input (batch_size × features)
  → Reshape to (batch_size × 1 × features)
  → LSTM Layer 1 (128 units)
  → LSTM Layer 2 (128 units)
  → Take last output
  → Dense Layer (64 units)
  → Output (1 value: predicted return)
```

**Configuration:**
```json
"model_training_parameters": {
  "hidden": 128,
  "layers": 2,
  "dropout": 0.2,
  "use_attention": false,
  "epochs": 10,
  "batch_size": 64,
  "lr": 0.001,
  "weight_decay": 0.0001
}
```

**Key Changes:**
- ❌ Removed: Attention mechanism (was causing dimension errors)
- ❌ Removed: Sequence parameter (not needed with simplified input)
- ✅ Added: Automatic input reshaping in forward pass
- ✅ Added: Simplified output layer architecture

---

### 2. **Base LEA Strategy** ✅ IMPROVED
**File:** `/home/pi/lea-freqai-system/user_data/strategies/LeaFreqAIStrategy.py`

**Key Features:**

**A. Stationary Feature Engineering**
- `%ret_1`, `%ret_3`, `%ret_12` - Price returns (1, 3, 12 candles)
- `%atr14_rel` - Relative ATR (volatility)
- `%rng_24` - 24-candle range
- `%z_48` - Z-score for mean reversion
- `%vol_z_48` - Volume anomaly detection
- RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands

**B. Market Regime Detection** ✅ FIXED
- BTC trend correlation (fixed alignment issues)
- Market volatility measurement
- Proper handling of BTC pair itself (no self-reference)

**C. Entry Signal Logic**
```python
ENTER when:
  - Predictions available (guard added)
  - LSTM prediction > 0.0 (positive return expected)
  - RSI < 75 (not overbought)
  - Volume > 0
  - BTC trend > -10% (market not crashing)
  - Price > EMA 200 (uptrend)
```

**D. Exit Signal Logic**
```python
EXIT when:
  - Predictions available (guard added)
  - LSTM prediction < 0.0 (negative return expected)
  - OR RSI > 85 (extreme overbought)
```

**E. Position Sizing**
- Dynamic sizing based on prediction confidence
- Multiplier: 0.5x to 1.5x of base stake
- Higher confidence = larger position
- Returns default stake if predictions unavailable

**F. Risk Management**
- Hard stoploss: -15%
- Trailing stop: Activates at +1% profit, trails at +2%
- ROI targets: 10% → 5% → 2% → 1%

**Major Fixes (2025-10-12):**
- ✅ Added prediction availability guards in all methods
- ✅ Fixed BTC trend feature calculation (was causing 89% NaN data)
- ✅ Improved data alignment to prevent index mismatches
- ✅ Strategy no longer crashes when models aren't ready

---

### 3. **Configuration** ✅ OPTIMIZED
**File:** `/home/pi/lea-freqai-system/user_data/config.json`

**Settings:**
- Strategy: `LeaFreqAIStrategy`
- Dry run: Enabled
- Wallet: 1000 USDT
- Max open trades: 3
- Pairs: BTC/USDT, ETH/USDT, BNB/USDT, SOL/USDT, ADA/USDT
- Timeframe: 5m
- FreqAI: Enabled
- Telegram: Disabled (optional)
- API Server: Port 8080 (localhost only - secure)

**Optimizations (2025-10-12):**
- Reduced timeframes: 3 → 1 (5m only)
- Reduced correlation pairs: 2 → 1 (BTC/USDT only)
- Result: Faster analysis, less computational overhead

---

### 4. **Market Data** ✅
**Downloaded:** 30 days of historical data

**Pairs:**
- BTC/USDT: 8,889 candles (5m)
- ETH/USDT: 8,889 candles (5m)
- BNB/USDT: 8,889 candles (5m)
- SOL/USDT: 8,889 candles (5m)
- ADA/USDT: 8,889 candles (5m)

## Issues Fixed (2025-10-12)

### ❌ Issue 1: LSTM Matrix Dimension Mismatch
**Error:** `RuntimeError: mat1 and mat2 shapes cannot be multiplied (1x64 and 128x64)`

**Root Cause:**
- LSTM model expected 3D input (batch, sequence, features)
- FreqAI provides 2D input (batch, features)
- Attention mechanism was complicating the architecture

**Solution:**
- Rewrote LSTM model to accept 2D input
- Added automatic reshaping in forward pass
- Simplified architecture (removed attention)
- Properly aligned layer dimensions

**Result:** ✅ Models training successfully without errors

---

### ❌ Issue 2: 89% Training Data Dropped (NaN)
**Error:** `WARNING - 89 percent of training data dropped due to NaNs, model may perform inconsistent`

**Root Cause:**
- BTC trend feature `btc_ema_50__btc` was improperly calculated
- Used `merge_informative_pair` incorrectly
- BTC pair referenced itself causing circular issues
- Index alignment problems

**Solution:**
- Fixed BTC feature calculation logic
- Proper index alignment with `reindex()` and `ffill()`
- Added check to prevent BTC pair from referencing itself
- Use neutral values when BTC data unavailable

**Result:** ✅ 0% data dropped due to NaNs

---

### ❌ Issue 3: Strategy Crashes on Missing Predictions
**Error:** `KeyError: '&-prediction'`

**Root Cause:**
- Strategy accessed prediction column before models ready
- No guards for missing predictions during initial training

**Solution:**
- Added prediction availability checks in:
  - `populate_entry_trend()`
  - `populate_exit_trend()`
  - `confirm_trade_entry()`
  - `custom_stake_amount()`
- Return safe defaults when predictions unavailable

**Result:** ✅ No crashes during model training phase

---

### ❌ Issue 4: Slow Strategy Analysis
**Warning:** `Strategy analysis took 80.36s, more than 25% of the timeframe (75.00s)`

**Root Cause:**
- Too many timeframes being analyzed (5m, 15m, 1h)
- Too many correlation pairs (BTC, ETH)

**Solution:**
- Reduced `include_timeframes` from 3 to 1
- Reduced `include_corr_pairlist` from 2 to 1
- Optimized feature engineering

**Result:** ✅ Faster analysis, reduced computational load

---

## How to Monitor

### 1. Check Bot Status
```bash
ps aux | grep "freqtrade trade" | grep -v grep
```

**Expected Output:**
```
pi  3568  77.1  39.4  ... freqtrade trade --config ...
```

### 2. View Live Logs
```bash
tail -f /home/pi/lea-freqai-system/freqtrade.log
```

**Look for:**
- "Starting training [PAIR]" - Models training
- "Training model on X features" - Training started
- No "RuntimeError" or "mat1" errors
- "No model ready" warnings (normal during initial training)

### 3. Check Model Files
```bash
ls -la /home/pi/lea-freqai-system/user_data/models/lea-lstm-v1/
```

**Should see:**
- `sub-train-BTC_*` directories
- `sub-train-ETH_*` directories
- `sub-train-BNB_*` directories
- etc.

### 4. View Performance (Once Trading Starts)
```bash
cd /home/pi/lea-freqai-system
source .venv/bin/activate

# Check trades
freqtrade show-trades --db-url sqlite:///tradesv3.dryrun.sqlite

# Check current status
freqtrade status

# Or use Web UI
# http://localhost:8080
```

### 5. Stop/Start Bot
```bash
# Stop
pkill -9 -f "freqtrade trade"

# Start
cd /home/pi/lea-freqai-system
source .venv/bin/activate
nohup freqtrade trade --config user_data/config.json --strategy LeaFreqAIStrategy --freqaimodel LeaTorchLSTM --logfile freqtrade.log > /dev/null 2>&1 &
```

### Success Metrics to Track
1. **Prediction Accuracy:** LSTM forecast vs actual returns (correlation)
2. **Risk-Adjusted Returns:** Sharpe ratio > 1.0
3. **Drawdown Control:** Max DD < 25%
4. **Trade Quality:** Profit factor > 1.4

---

## Troubleshooting

### Bot Won't Start
```bash
# Check logs
tail -100 /home/pi/lea-freqai-system/freqtrade.log

# Check if port is in use
lsof -i :8080

# Kill existing processes
pkill -9 -f "freqtrade trade"
```

### No Trades Happening
**Possible reasons:**
1. Models still training (normal for first 10-15 min)
   ```bash
   tail -f freqtrade.log | grep "Starting training"
   ```
2. No entry signals (market conditions don't match)
   - Check predictions are being generated
   - Review current market conditions
3. All trade slots full (max 3 trades)
   ```bash
   source .venv/bin/activate
   freqtrade status
   ```

### Model Training Errors
**If you see RuntimeError:**
```bash
# Check for dimension errors
grep "RuntimeError\|mat1" freqtrade.log

# If errors persist, model architecture needs adjustment
```

**If you see high NaN percentage:**
```bash
# Check for NaN warnings
grep "NaN\|dropped.*training points" freqtrade.log

# Should see "dropped 0 training points" if fixed properly
```

### Strategy Crashes
```bash
# Check for KeyError
grep "KeyError.*prediction" freqtrade.log

# Should not see any if guards are in place
```
